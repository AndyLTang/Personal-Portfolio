# Personal Portfolio
My personal static web portfolio, written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Icons and images are created in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

## Highlights
 * Features a modern single page web design with flat/metro style UI
 * Responsive web design to conform to different device sizes by using media queries to adjust the size of grids
 * Employs modal window (lightbox) to show additional information about my previous projects by using CSS and Javascript
